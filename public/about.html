<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Amir, a dedicated and results-driven Computing Science student currently
  pursuing my degree at Thompson Rivers University in Canada. With a solid
  foundation in IT support, I have gained valuable real-world experience through
  co-op positions and certifications, such as the Google IT Support Certificate.
  My journey from Bangladesh to Canada for higher studies has been both
  enriching and challenging, allowing me to grow not only as a student but also
  as a professional in the tech industry.

  My expertise spans across a variety of technical skills, including
  troubleshooting hardware and software issues, providing seamless IT support,
  and managing complex IT systems. I have hands-on experience with technologies
  like Java, Oracle SQL, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, enabling me to
  contribute to both backend and frontend solutions. Beyond technical skills, I
  am passionate about problem-solving, optimizing systems, and helping
  organizations improve their IT infrastructure to operate more efficiently.

  Driven by curiosity and a desire for continuous learning, I am now exploring
  more advanced areas in software architecture and design, as well as operating
  systems. I am excited to leverage my growing knowledge and skills to take on
  new challenges and make meaningful contributions to the IT and software
  development fields. Whether itâ€™s resolving system issues or designing complex
  applications, I am always ready to dive in and deliver results.
